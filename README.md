# Artificial Agents for Humanitarian Assistance
Repository for RefugeeGPT

This is the source code for the project [RefugeeGPT](https://refugee.lipsti.cc), an artificial agent designed to assist refugees and the general public with comprehensive information on laws, regulations, and programs related to asylum in the United States. With this effort, we explore the potential of AI to enhance decision-making in refugee status determinations, improve access to legal aid, and offer psychological support.

The project manuscript is available [here](https://aarushgupta.com/refugee.pdf).
